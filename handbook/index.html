      <h2>Mission and Values</h2>
      <h3>Team Mission</h3>
      <p>To empower our students to grow into passionate and skilled STEM leaders through competitive robotics.</p>
    </br>
      <h3>Team Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong>&mdash; Integrity is more than just telling the truth. Integrity is an all-encompassing idea that you should always do the right thing. This includes having discussions that are honest, making good decisions even when no one is looking, and always seeking the truth.</li>
        </br>
        <li><strong>Self Advocacy</strong>&mdash; Success is yours to own. It’s your job to insert yourself wherever you think you should be, and to communicate your needs to coaches and mentors. Be an agent for change.</li>
        </br>
        <li><strong>Growth Mindset</strong>&mdash; Always look for ways to improve not only in skill but in attitude and relationships. Part of having a growth mindset is having humility for your current level of ability or lack thereof. Accept that you have a lifetime of untapped potential and that part of being in 7028 is unlocking that potential.</li>
        </br>
        <li><strong>Excellence</strong>&mdash; Commit to delivering high-quality work that meets or exceeds expectations. Be proud of the work you do by pushing yourself to achieve at a higher level. Don’t settle for “just good enough”.</li>
        </br>
        <li><strong>Gracious Professionalism</strong>&mdash; Gracious Professionalism is a way of doing things that encourages high quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. Gracious professionals make valued contributions in a manner pleasing to others and to themselves. In the end, Gracious Professionalism is part of pursuing a meaningful life. When professionals use knowledge in a gracious manner and individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and society benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Policies</h2>
      <h3>7028 is an equal opportunity organization</h3>
      <p>7028 and its members may not discriminate against any other member on the basis of immutable characteristics including but not limited to race, gender, sexual identity, or ability. This also includes individuals outside of the team at all team events such as competitions, outreach events, and fundraisers. We believe this sentiment is critical in creating an environment where everyone can thrive.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>No member may use equipment they have not had safety training on</h3>
      <p>For the safety of our members, students and mentors may only use tools and equipment they have had formal safety training on in the past two years. Never use a machine you have not been trained on. Never use equipment you are unsure about. Never use equipment in a manner that is unsafe.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>Students may never be alone with an adult.</h3>
      <p>For the safety of our students, no mentor, coach, parent, or any other adult may ever be left alone with a student during practices, competitions, or other team events. Students and adults alike are asked to always be aware of situations like these occurring and must be avoided.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>7028 is an apolitical organization</h3>
      <p>While we believe it is absolutely critical for our students to freely express themselves on the team, political statements and symbols must not be associated with the 7028 brand. Political statements and symbols may not be present in any official team branding and/or marketing materials such as signs, pit, buttons, team shirts, handouts, or any other 7028 produced items.</p>

      <h2>7028 Facts That Matter</h2>
      <h3>First Robotics Competition is a mentorship program.</h3>
      <p>The relationship between students and mentors is that of a partnership. Mentors and students alike must work together effectively to achieve our goals. Mentors are here to support students in achieving their goals, and students are here to grow.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>7028 is supported by STMA Robotics.</h3>
      <p>STMA Robotics is a nonprofit organization that supports robotics programs in St. Michael-Albertville, including 7028. All funding for the team is donated by our sponsors and raised through team fundraisers. 7028 is not financially supported by the STMA school district and typically spends over $100,000 per year.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>7028 is not an STMA school sport/activity</h3>
      <p>7028 is run through STMA community education, not the high school itself. This means that students miss out some perks, like earning a letter. The benefit is that we have great freedom in how we decide to run our program. This is the way we prefer it at this time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="notion-card">
      <h2>Flat Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Assigned leadership roles are a great carrot to reward hard work and promote competition amongst members. But when you’re a world class high school robotics team that’s full of the most intelligent, innovative, and talented kids in the Midwest, telling them to sit back and do what they’re told by another student diminishes their value and experience.</p>
      </br>
      <p>We believe that leadership is voluntary and does not require a title. That’s why 7028 is flat. It’s our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any student managers, and no student “reports to” any other student. We do have team captains, but these students hold no authority over others. Captains are simply role models for the team that exemplify our mission and values. This team is yours to thrive in. You have the power to share and execute your ideas. You have the power to pursue your interests. A flat structure removes every organizational barrier between your passion and the team reaching its goals.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="notion-card">
      <h2>Mentorship</h2>
      <p>It may be easy to assume that our students are free to run the program in any way they see fit and that the adults are just there to supervise, but this is far from what our team is about. In 7028, our amazing mentors partner with our students to help them grow their abilities and to provide structure and accountability. Our mentors have years of valuable FRC experience to help keep students on track with their goals, provide structure and support, and to fill in gaps. We agree with FIRST in that mentors are just as important to run a successful FRC program as the students.</p>
      </br>
      <p>Mentors are here to bring out the best in our students through inspiration, education, collaboration, and demonstration. That statement can be interpreted in many different ways, but it really depends on the circumstance. Mentors completing tasks should never be prioritized over students completing those same tasks, but sometimes they need to fill in the gaps. It is totally normal and encouraged for mentors to work on a project alongside our students, whether that be helping turn a wrench, solder a wire, write some code, contribute ideas to discussions, or design a part. Your mentors are not passive observers and they are not your bosses. They are your partners in achieving your goals.</p>
